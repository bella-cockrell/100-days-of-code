# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Monday June 15 2020

**Today's Progress**: Began the Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) to brush up on my knowledge of Javascript. 78/101 lessons done on the first section in a couple of hours.

**Thoughts:**
I thought it would be a good place to start here, because it was easy enough to finish but it was also super useful, because it reinforced my understanding of basic topics and methods again, like .pop(), .push(), .shift() and .unshift(). I also relearned switch.cases; it's been months since I've read up on them. I'll try and use them instead of an if/else statement in the future. Side note: I sometimes worry that I will forget basic things about JavaScript -- completing these quick refresher lessons once every couple of months will dust the old cobwebs in my brain.

### Day 2: Tuesday June 16 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued to work on FCC's Javascript certification and watched a video on Jest and Enzyme testing in React. I also did some pair programming with a friend to fix a React component that was not updating when new data from an API was received. Turned out to be a bigger problem to fix than first thought.

**Thoughts:** I got quite stuck on manipulating JSON data with dot/bracket notation and conditions. Hopefully I'll get it right after a night's sleep. I think I would like to create a simple app that counts cards.

### Day 3: Wednesday June 17 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued to work on FCC's Javascript certification. Learnt about For, While, Do While and Recursion loops.

**Thoughts:** I feel bad that I had to look up what to do in the end for a question I was stuck on but I guess that's the equivalent of looking on StackOverflow. I felt worse when I didn't fully understand the answer either. However, later in the day, I was working with the same issue in another context and understood dot/bracket notation better alongside for/while loops.
