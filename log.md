# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Monday June 15 2020

**Today's Progress**: Began the Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) to brush up on my knowledge of Javascript. 78/101 lessons done on the first section in a couple of hours.

**Thoughts:**
I thought it would be a good place to start here, because it was easy enough to finish but it was also super useful, because it reinforced my understanding of basic topics and methods again, like .pop(), .push(), .shift() and .unshift(). I also relearned switch.cases; it's been months since I've read up on them. I'll try and use them instead of an if/else statement in the future. Side note: I sometimes worry that I will forget basic things about JavaScript -- completing these quick refresher lessons once every couple of months will dust the old cobwebs in my brain.
